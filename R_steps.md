After we created all artifacts in qiime2 such as ASV table, repseqs, unrooted tree, taxonomy table and metadata, now we can bring them into R by usign qiime2_R package in R. 

## 1. Importing unrooted tree, ASV table and repseqs with the metadata to R using qiime2R package into R. 
Using qiime2R package, we can bring all generated artifacts from qiime2 into R and integrate them into one phyloseq object by qiime_to_phyloseq()

```R
library("qiime2R")
library("phyloseq")

#ps total (pst) directly from qiime
pst <- qza_to_phyloseq(features = "./tableNoFilt.qza", tree = "./treeNoFilt.qza", 
                       taxonomy = "./Taxonomy/taxonomy-dssNoFilt.qza", metadata = "./metadataNoFilt.tsv")
 
#we need to merge the refseqs like this since in above fun, there is no argument for that
repseqs <- read_qza("./repseqsNoFilt.qza")$data

pst <- merge_phyloseq(pst, repseqs)
```

## 2. R-based analysis of microbiome data
When we imported all the artifacts from **qiime2** into **R**, we can use different packages and costume functions to render different *preprocessing* and *analitycal* steps.
