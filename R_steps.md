After we created all artifacts in qiime2 such as ASV table, repseqs, unrooted tree, taxonomy table and metadata, now we can bring them into R by usign qiime2_R package in R. 

## 1. Importing unrooted tree, ASV table and repseqs with the metadata to R using qiime2R package into R. 
Using qiime2R package, we can bring all generated artifacts from qiime2 into R and integrate them into one phyloseq object by qiime_to_phyloseq()

```R
library("qiime2R")
library("phyloseq")

pst <- qza_to_phyloseq(features = "./tableNoFilt.qza", tree = "./treeNoFilt.qza", 
                       taxonomy = "./Taxonomy/taxonomy-dssNoFilt.qza", metadata = "./metadataNoFilt.tsv")
 
#we need to merge the refseqs like this since in above fun, there is no argument for that
repseqs <- read_qza("./repseqsNoFilt.qza")$data

pst <- merge_phyloseq(pst, repseqs)

  
```

Now `pst` is a `phyloseq` object containing all the artifacts and the metadata to our samples.

```R
#Converting all non-numeric/logical charatcters in the metadata into factors including pig_no, treatment, dss and gb

for(i in seq_len(ncol(sample_data(pst)))) {
 if(!is.numeric(sample_data(pst)[[i]]) && !is.logical(sample_data(pst)[[i]])) {
    sample_data(pst)[[i]] = as.factor(sample_data(pst)[[i]])  } else {
     sample_data(pst)[[i]]
 } 
}

#Optional: renaming the treatment levels
iflese(sample_data(pst)$treatment == "ct", "CT", ifelse(sample_data(pst)$treatment == "gb", "GB",
ifelse(sample_data(pst)$treatment == "dss", "DSS", ifelse(sample_data(pst)$treatment == "gbdss", "GBDSS", "NegCtrl"))

# Releveling the treatment factrs

sample_data(pst)$treatment<-factor(sample_data(pst)$treatment, levels = c('CT','GB','DSS', 'GBDSS','NegCtrl'))
```

## 2. R-based analysis of microbiome data
When we imported all the artifacts from **qiime2** into **R**, we can use different packages and costume functions to render different *preprocessing* and *analitycal* steps.
