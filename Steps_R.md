## 1. Importing unrooted tree, ASV table and repseqs with the metadata to R using qiime2R package into R. 
Using qiime2R package, we can bring all generated artifacts from qiime2 into R and integrate them into one phyloseq object by qiime_to_phyloseq()

## 2. R-based analysis of microbiome data
When we imported all the artifacts from **qiime2** into **R**, we can use different packages and costume functions to render different *preprocessing* and *analitycal* steps.
