# Microbiome_Analysis
 Analysis of (gut) microbiome in Qiime2 and R.

In this module, I will walk you through the necessary steps involved in analysis of microbiome sequence data from raw sequences to publication quality graphs and visualizations. The module includs the following steps:

## 1. Quality control and merging paired-end sequences (in Qiime2)

In this step we use DADA2 packege to create the ASV tables and representative sequences (repseqs).

## 2. Training a primer region-specific classifier for taxonomic classificaiton by Naive-Bayes method (in Qiime2)
