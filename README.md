## Analysis of (gut) microbiome in Qiime2 and R.

In this module, I will walk you through the necessary steps involved in analysis of microbiome sequence data from raw sequences to publication quality graphs and visualizations. The module includes the following steps:

##1. Quality control and merging paired-end sequences (in Qiime2)
In this step we use DADA2 package to create the ASV tables and representative sequences (repseqs).

##2. Training a primer region-specific classifier for taxonomic classification by Naïve-Bayes method (in Qiime2)
In this step RESCRIPr will be used for creating more region specific, more sensitive based on our primerset.
